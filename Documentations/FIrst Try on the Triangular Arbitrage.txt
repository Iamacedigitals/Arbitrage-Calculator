an arbitrage exists when the implied cross rate is not equal to the quoted cross rate

quoted cross rate for btc

btcusdt = 70 000
btcngn = 70 000 000 ngn(Q)
usdt ngn = 997 

How did i get this implied cross rate 
if 1 dollar is 997 ngn
and 70000 dollar give 1 btc 
how many ngn will give 1 btc

Calculation is 
1 usd = 997 ngn
70 000 usd = x ngn

since x ngn = 1 btc
then 997 * 70 000 usd = 1 BTC
btcngn implied == 69 790 000 BTC(I)

COnceptualization:
How did we come up with this 

to come up with this we need an algorithm to compare the rates, How?? By comparing the values for 2 conversion rates by nultipling any two together
for instance
if btcngn is 70 000 is usdtngn * btcusdt == btcngn if yes try another pair if no arbitrage exists
now for arbitrage to e profittable then the btcusdt * usdtngn must be less than that of btcngn else ARBITRAGE IS NOT PROFITTABLE

Lets test it
1 btc = 70 000 usdt
x btc =  1 usdt
0.0000142857 btc

since x btc = 997 ngn
0.0000142857 = 997 ngn

now usdtngn in this case is given by 
usdt ngn = btcngn * 
0.0000142857 * 70 000 000 = 1000 ngn


Btc 
buy usdt with ngn and buy btc with usdt and then sell btc for ngn

ngn -> Usdt -> Btc -> ngn

say we invest 1000 usd in this arbitrage

1000 usdt = 1000 * 997 / ngn
= 997 000 ngn

quoted cross rate = 70 000

1000 usdt = x btc
70000 usdt = 1 btc
if 1usdt = 1 000 ngn

implied cross rate

1000 usdt = 0.01428

btc  ->  ngn = 1 000 000 ngn

profit of 30 000 000


		  Ngn    
	     / 		 \
	    / 	          \
	  btc	------	usdt


the value of the final currency must be worth something else the arbitrage will be worthless
